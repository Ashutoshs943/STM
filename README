Smart traffic detection using opencv.

Our algorithm basically provides traffic information- average movement of vehicles and percentage of area covered by vehicles on the road.

How to use the code:
-Place a video file ("traffic.avi") in the same directory of executable file.
-Run the code.
-In "draw polygon" window choose four points in cw direction to select roi on the road. Press enter.

How the code works?
